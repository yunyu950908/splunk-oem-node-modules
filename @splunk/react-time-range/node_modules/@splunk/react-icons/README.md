# React Icons
A library of icons.

## Install

1. Intall three peer dependencies: `react`, `react-dom` and `styled-components`.
    ```
    npm install react react-dom styled-components
    ```
1. Install the icons package.
    ```
    npm install @splunk/react-icons
    ```

## Production Builds

`@splunk/react-icons` and React support production and development builds. The production build removes warnings and guidance from the output. To create a production build, set the environment variable `NODE_ENV` to `"production"` and use the webpack [DefinePlugin](https://webpack.github.io/docs/list-of-plugins.html#defineplugin) to inject the variable into the code.
